# Pick-and-place-Tecnomatix-
This is simulation of Industrial robot for pick and place of object performing task. This is a project for Flexible automation couse- Robotic engineering University of genova, italy


## Software requirements

* Creo Parametric 5.0.4.0
* Tecnomatix/Process Simulate


## Design
The design of Components needed for simulation can be classified as follows:
1) Desinging of parts and components using **PTC Creo** (Bolltle, Rotating table, and Stationary table with bottle)
2) Import the parts and components into **tecnomatic** using a JT file.
3) Stimulating a Industrial robot for Pick and place a botlle from stationary table to another table.
